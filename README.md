<div align="center">This is the official project of our paper <b>Is a Green Screen Really Necessary for Real-Time Human Matting?</b></div>
<div align="center">MODNet is a <b>trimap-free</b> model for human matting in <b>real time</b> (on a single GPU).</div>
<div align="center">Our amazing demo, code, pre-trained model, and validation benchmark are coming soon!</div>

## Announcement
I have received some requests for accessing our code. I am sorry that we need some time to get everything ready since this repository is now supported by Zhanghan Ke alone. Our plans in the next few months are:
- We first plan to publish an online image/video matting demo along with the pre-trained model in Dec. 2020.
- We then plan to release the code of supervised training and unsupervised SOC in Jan. 2021.
- We finally plan to open source the PHM-100 validation benchmark in Feb. 2021.

We look forward to your continued attention to this project. Thanks.
